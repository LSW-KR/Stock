This code is written in Python and is used to scrape stock market data.

> 1. First, it imports the 'pykrx' library which is a python wrapper for the Korea Exchange (KRX) website. This library is used to scrape data from KRX.
> 2. It also imports the 'pandas' library which is used to manipulate and analyze data.
> 3. The 'FinanceDataReader' library is also imported, which is used to access the financial data of various markets.
> 4. It then imports 'datetime' library that is used to handle date and time.
> 5. 'mariadb' library is also imported which is a python wrapper for MariaDB, it is a relational database management system.
> 6. It then creates an empty DataFrame and assigns 'stock' attribute to it.
> 7. It then uses the 'StockListing' function from the 'FinanceDataReader' library to retrieve a list of stocks listed on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets.
> 8. It then appends the KOSDAQ stock data to the KOSPI stock data.
> 9. It then creates a list of symbols of the stock and assigns it to the variable 'symbol_list'.
> 10. The last line of the code prints the last item in the symbol_list.

Note: This script uses the 'FinanceDataReader' library to access the financial data of various markets. Users need to install this library before running this script. Also, it is important to note that the 'mariadb' library is not being used in this script and its import is unnecessary.
Also, the symbol_list_temp variable is not being used and can be removed.
It is also important to note that this script is only importing the libraries, creating a DataFrame and retrieve the stock symbols of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets. Any further functionality would need to be added to the script in order to utilize the data.
This code is a test code to check for stock code
